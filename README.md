# Taiga

Taiga is an open-source desktop application for Windows. It automatically detects the anime videos you're watching on your computer and synchronizes your progress with online services such as [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io) and [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net). It helps you manage your anime library, discover new series, share watched episodes and download new ones.
